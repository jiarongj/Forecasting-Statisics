data:  x
t = 0.70372, df = 49, p-value = 0.4849
alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 10
95 percent confidence interval:
  9.924374 10.157135
sample estimates:
mean of x 
 10.04075 
 
Explanation: null-hypothesis H0 as mean1 = mean2 = 10
if p-value <=0.05: means the mean1 not in 95% confidence interval of the mean2 range, thus reject the null-hypothesis
like google says "If the P-value is less, reject the null hypothesis. If the P-value is more, keep the null hypothesis. 
0.003 < 0.05, so we have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis and accept the claim.
Here p-value = 0.48 >0.05, we cannot reject the null-hypothesis, thus have to agree that mean1 = mean2 = 10
